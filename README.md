# Employee-Attrition-Prediction-ML-Project
Built a Machine Learning model to predict employee attrition using Python. Performed data cleaning, EDA, and trained models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest). Derived insights on factors influencing attrition to support HR data-driven retention strategies.

### Project Overview
I analyzed a real-world HR dataset containing employee demographics, job satisfaction, salary, and performance metrics. Using advanced ML techniques, I built predictive models to understand the key drivers of attrition.
 
### Key Steps in the Project

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.

= Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Discovered patterns between job role, work-life balance, salary hike, and attrition rate through visualizations.

- Model Building: Implemented multiple algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

- Evaluation: Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to select the most effective predictor.

- Insights: Identified critical factors like job satisfaction, overtime, and years at company that strongly influence attrition.

### Outcome
The final model achieved high prediction accuracy and offered valuable insights into employee behavior, enabling data-driven HR strategies for employee retention.
